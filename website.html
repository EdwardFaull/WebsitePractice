<h1 class = "topic">Computer Science</h1>
<p>My computer science coursework has not begun yet.<br />
While this is the case, I have been busy at work in my computer science lessons and at home to practice coding.<br />
The language we are studying in lessons is C#. This is a versatile coding language and I have gained a good grasp of it relatively quickly.<br />
This has been helped by my work at home on the topic, as I have been experimenting with developing in game engines, including Unity, which uses C# as its primary language.<br />
Below is an example of some of the programs I have been working on in lesson time to improve my skills in programming in C#.<br /></p>

<p>
This is a piece of code that receives a word from the user.<br />
The code then takes the word and outputs the character in the opposite position to the currently selected one.<br />
This reverses the order of the word and spells it backwards onto the screen. <br />
<br />
Try out a JavaScript equivalent for yourself:</p>

<input type="text" id="word" value="Enter a word...">
<button onclick="myFunction()">Reverse</button>
<p id="return"></p>


<h2 class = "topic">EPQ</h2>
<p>I am planning on completing an Extended Project Qualification.<br />
   For this, I am planning on creating a demo of a video game.<br />
   While I already have experience in Unity, I decided that it would be best to make the game in Unreal.<br />
   A drawback of this is that C# is not officially supported by Unreal, only C++.<br />
   Thus, I have also been learning C++ as well as C#.<br />
   I have not yet begun developing my game in Unreal, but I have been using my time to learn standard C++ syntax before learning the code for Unreal.</p>
